    abstract = {This paper presents new empirical evidence of predictability of individual stock returns. The negative first-order serial correlation in monthly stock returns is highly significant. Furthermore, significant positive serial correlation is found at longer lags, and the twelve-month serial correlation is particularly strong. Using the observed systematic behavior of stock returns, one-step-ahead return forecasts are made and ten portfolios are formed from the forecasts. The difference between the abnormal returns on the extreme decile portfolios over the period 1934-1987 is 2.49 percent per month.},
